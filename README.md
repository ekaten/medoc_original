## "MEDOC" - Patient's Medical History Management Platform
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/5w0lru3fXgQ>

### Description:

#### General Information:

    MEDOC" is a platform created to conveniently store, edit and share patient's medical
    history.

Created for the convenience of both Patient and Provider, the platform prioritizes patientâ€™s privacy allowing them to choose which parts of the medical history they want to share with each Provider.

##### For Patients:
It alowes Patient to create and store a complete medical history file, including personal medical history, family medical history and medications that the patient currently taking with simple and convenient templates, thus saving time and paper at the doctor's office.

    The personal medical history file can be shared with a registered Provider or used as a template when the Patient needs to fill out a paper form at the doctor's office - conveniently storing information like medication names, dosage and schedules at Patient's fingertips.

##### For Providers:


    A complete list of medications the Patient is taking is extremely valuable for Provider to avoid any prescribed medication interference.

##### The goal:
The main goal of this platform is to create a centralized system for all Patients to securely store, edit and share their medical data with any Provider they choose to share it with and in form they want to share it.
